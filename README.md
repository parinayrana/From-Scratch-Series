# 🧠 Machine Learning & Beyond – Models from Scratch

This repository is a hands-on learning journey where I implement core **Machine Learning** algorithms from scratch using only **Python** and **NumPy**.  
The goal is to strengthen my intuition by **translating mathematical formulations into code**, without using high-level libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

As the project grows, I will extend it to cover **Deep Learning**, **Attention Mechanisms**, and **Transformers** from scratch too.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 🧠 Deepen understanding of ML/DL fundamentals  
- 🧮 Rebuild algorithms purely from mathematical definitions  
- 🧱 Create reusable components like optimizers, activation functions, and evaluation metrics  
- 📈 Develop a progression from classical ML → deep learning → advanced architectures

## ✅ Current Progress

All implementations are inside the `ML_Models/` directory.

| Algorithm             | Status      | Details                                |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression     | ✅ Completed | Closed-form & Gradient Descent         |
| Logistic Regression   | ✅ Completed | Sigmoid, Binary Classification         |
| K-Nearest Neighbors   | ✅ Completed | Distance metrics, manual K logic       |
| ...                   | 🔜 Planned   | Decision Trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc. |
